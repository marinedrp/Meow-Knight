TODO =====>
- Add the attack animation
- Draw the enemies
- First NPC must move from left to right (there's a tutorial on this for platforms on YT) 



Problems:
- Background :
    - Background to the left (it doesn't happen only at the begin)
    - The animation of the player is printed several times if I go on the left (probably at position.x = 0)


- Text boxes : 
    - It's a CSS box that is not actually drawn on the canvas, so if I zoom in our our the text box is not scaled properly
    - The player is still able to move when the text is being printed (so he may skip the first text displays by the NPC which tells him what to do)
    I know how to stop the player from moving but I want to do that until the end of the animation.
    - The player is still able to see the text box if he is far away and can't remove it because he is not colliding with the NPC
    - If I press space on the second level I get an error (the game is not crashing though) even though I added a condition on my code (player must be on level 1)
    And I actually don't need it because there's no NPCs on the second level



- Levels :



LASTLY =====> 
- Check performance
- Organize the code ("player is not defined" etc.)
